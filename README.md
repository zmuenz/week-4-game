# week-4-game

* I created a mobile-responsive Crystal Collector game

* Each crystal is randomly chosen from an array of crystal images, and each one is assigned a random point value.

* You must click each crystal and gain points to hit the target score without going over.

* Wins and losses are recorded, and each win or loss will reset the randomly generated crystals and values.
